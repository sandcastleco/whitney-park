## What does “Suburban Convenience, Urban Lifestyle” mean?

### Suburban Convenience

Whitney Park Townhomes breaks the mold by providing affordable, new, single-family construction to the near-downtown market with all the features you’d expect in a new suburban home:

* 2-story home with full basement
* Open concept living area with modern kitchen amenities and conveniences
* 3 bedroom,  2 ½ bath units
* Full-size washer and dryer hookups on the second floor
* 2-stall attached garage, providing easily-accessible, secure, and free parking
* “Chicago-style” patio on garage roof

PLUS, the best part:  **No Condo Fees!**  This is a townhome, constructed side-by-side in a row, meaning you own the land underneath your home and maintain your property as you would in any typical neighborhood.  While condo-like in design and functionality, there are no common elements and no condo association—and therefore, no monthly maintenance fees.  Your home and the grounds around it are yours to design and enjoy.

### Urban Lifestyle

Located on Whitney Park, enjoy the cool shade of the tree canopy in the summer and the ice rink in the winter.  Or retreat to your private, Chicago-style, garage roof patio where you can enjoy a day of sunbathing or reading a magazine.

So much is available within footsteps of your front door!  Start your day with coffee at The Attic; grab a gallon of milk at CVS/pharmacy; read a book at the Brown County Library; or meet friends for dinner at one of the numerous restaurants and bars located mere blocks from home.  Afterwards, work off that meal on a 5-mile jog along the East River Trail—two blocks away—that continues onto the Fox River Trail.

And when you need your car, it’s waiting for you inside your secure, weather-protected, 2-stall garage.  With rear alley access, there’s minimal driveway to maintain.  Snow removal is quick and easy!
