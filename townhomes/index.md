    <p class="mt0">So much is available within footsteps of your front door! Start your day with coffee at The Attic; grab a gallon of milk at CVS/pharmacy; read a book at the Brown County Library; or meet friends for dinner at one of the numerous restaurants and bars located mere blocks from home. Afterwards, work off that meal on a 5-mile jog along the East River Trail—two blocks away—that continues onto the Fox River Trail. Located on Whitney Park, enjoy the cool shade of the tree canopy in the summer and the ice rink in the winter.</p>

    <h3>No condo fees!</h3>

    <p>This is a townhome, constructed side-by-side in a row, meaning you own the land underneath your home and maintain your property as you would in any typical neighborhood. While condo-like in design and functionality, there are no common elements and no condo association—and therefore, no monthly maintenance fees. Your home and the grounds around it are yours to design and enjoy.</p>
